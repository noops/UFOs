### Resources:

Data: data.js 

Software: javascript, CSS, html, D3, visual studio code

### Overview:

App2.js and index2.html combine to create a webpage with a dynamic table. There are several filters that can be used to sort data imported to the webpage from data.js. The webpage is highly dependent on the D3 library. The filtering function uses D3 selections combined with other attributes and properties in order to filter by user input. Because it uses D3 selections, the filtering function is reusable for other dynamic tables. The only thing that would need to be updated is the html file. For further development I would like to incorporate some sort of drop down list capable of removing columns for ease of reading.
